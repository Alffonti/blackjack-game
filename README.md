# Concepts I've learned in this project

- arrays (creating an array and the `push` method to add an element(s) to the end of an array
- objects (creating them and storing key-value pairs)
- booleans (`true` or `false`)
- conditional statements (`if else`)
- comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `===`)
- logical operators (`&&`, `||`)
- for loops
- the Math object (`random` and `floor` methods)
- the `return` statement
